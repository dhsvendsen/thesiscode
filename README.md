# Code developed for M.Sc thesis of Daniel H. Svendsen

This is the code written thoughout the course of my masters thesis at DTU. The two first "binning" python notebooks load data from the SensibleDTU experiment (not accesible w/o contract), cleans it, and bins it into timewindows of different sizes.

The final (very large) python notebook, uses the multiplex infomap algorithm to detect temporal communities. It is split up into two large sections, one for each type of data, each filled with multifarious analysis.
